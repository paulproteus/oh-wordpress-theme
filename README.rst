This is a small bit of code that takes an input bit of HTML and
generates a WordPress theme. You can use it to generate a WordPress
theme.

Overview
========

Here's the basic idea:

You provide an input/index.html file. The file contains replaceable
bits like like "WORDPRESS_MAIN". Then you run 'make'.

This code will process that file and, for each magic word as defined
in the replaceable/ directory, replace the magic word with a little
bit of PHP code.

It will then save the resulting WordPress theme file in
output/index.php.

(Note: To make it generate a style.css file, which is a required part
of every WordPress theme, you need to configure it. To do that,
copy "theme.cfg.EXAMPLE" to "theme.cfg" and 'make' again.)

Then you can copy the contents of output/ into right path for
your WordPress site.

Details for OpenHatch
=====================

Since this toolkit was written originally for theming the OpenHatch
blog, there is documentation on exactly how to use it with the
OpenHatch codebase.

For that, see OpenHatch_blog_theming.rst.

Status
======

Right now, the project is a mostly-functional hack.

Origin
======

This project began because Asheesh Laroia kept having to fix the
OpenHatch.org blog when the OpenHatch main site design changed. The
idea is to store a stub of a WordPress theme as a Django template,
then use this external software to convert that stub into an actual
WordPress theme.
